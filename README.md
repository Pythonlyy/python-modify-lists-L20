# 🔧 Modify, Add, and Remove Items from a List

Lists in Python are **mutable**, which means you can change them any time! You can update values, add new ones, or remove items with simple syntax.

## 💡 What You'll Learn

* How to change a value in a list using its index
* How to add new values with `.append()`
* How to remove values using `.remove()`

---

## 💻 Full Example with Explanations

### 🧾 Start with a list:

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
```

### 🎨 Change an item by index:

```python
colors[0] = "pink"
print(colors)
```

🖨️ Output:

```
['pink', 'green', 'blue']
```

### ➕ Add an item to the end:

```python
colors.append("yellow")
print(colors)
```

🖨️ Output:

```
['pink', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow']
```

### ❌ Remove a specific item:

```python
colors.remove("green")
print(colors)
```

🖨️ Output:

```
['pink', 'blue', 'yellow']
```

## 📌 Key Notes

* Use `list[index] = value` to change an item
* `.append()` always adds to the end
* `.remove()` deletes the first match it finds
* Lists are ordered — changes keep the order intact

## 🧪 Try It Yourself

```python
shopping = ["eggs", "milk", "bread"]

shopping.append("butter")
shopping[1] = "oat milk"
shopping.remove("eggs")

print(shopping)
```

### 🔈 Expected Output

```
['oat milk', 'bread', 'butter']
```
